So be warned, you could die.  Gorillas in the schist is located on the left (downstream) side of BVF.  There is an obvious weakness that sometimes has ice beneath it.  there is one left diagonal crack 2 meters in length in the middle of the route.  the route ascends this crack and follows the obvious weakness above it.  At this point if you decide to bail you will prove that you have good risk assessment skills and will live to climb another route.  If you climb the final 30 feet to the top of the cliffband you will have completed the 2nd ascent of Gorillas in the Schist.  This climb was followed by Dawn Glanc and witness by Mike Mcneil.

Rarely, such gambles pay off and you find something at least ok to pretty good (like the route Tenuous for me on Veiny recently) ... other times you experience something like this. First the good: The climbing on the top of Belmont Brie is really engaging. Steep sustained 5.9 crimping through rolling bulges with good rock quality and interesting holds. Otherwise, this thing has a lot of drawbacks. First of all, the guidebook 5.8 rating is a bit sandbagged. Taking everything into account, I would rate it 5.9+. The bottom has suspect rock quality and lots of slick lichen on it. The middle of the route is a total chossy mess. Protection on the route is unreliable, the bolting is bizarre, and the anchors are suspect. In its current condition, this route should probably be avoided. ", "   If you do decide to give this thing a try...To start, cautiously ascend a shallow dihedral to the right with delicate footwork on lichen-slick rock to the first bolt. You will discover that most of the 8 bolts here are loose spinning buttonheads-- really unreliable in the case of a lead fall. Bolts 2 and 3 are also inexplicably way off line to the left (what the first ascentionists were thinking here, I'm not sure... Was the rock quality better in 1989? Were they trying to avoid extending a draw for some reason?). To clip or clean these bolts requires awkward destabilizing lunges out onto crumbling, featureless lichen-covered rock. The middle section is slightly steeper with less lichen and the bolt line back where it should be , but the rock quality deteriorates further. Holds flex, and the belayer will probably feel like an extra in the Mel Gibson movie THE PATRIOT as musket-ball shaped chunks of rocks will fall upon him/her with greater rapidity than your average Revolutionary War Hessian trooper could fire! Then the pretty darn good top, followed by the decayed \"roll the dice\" disaster that are the anchors. My partner (who backed up the anchor to lower me) and I both sent this thing cleanly, and he won the rappel lottery. BTW, This route's alternate name is Don't Leave Webbing On the Rock (so listed in the older Phinney guide), so there is some kind of story here that I, as an out of towner, don't know.

Nonetheless, the rock quality and movement are quite good. The route features some bigger, steeper moves that utilize positive knobs, crimps, and dishes.

I decided to list the R safety rating for this route that I think was in the old Phinney guidebook as opposed to the PG13 in the more modern Busse and Burr version.

A fall there could well result in the leader falling on top of the belayer, decking in the gulley, or getting impaled on the fin at the top of Make Believe .

They originally had no intention of climbing it due to the fact that you can just walk off the back. The day before they had set pre-placed pitons to move things along. After a couple of pitches up the Conns gained a obvious ledge in which became known as, \" The Balloon Ledge\" because the Conns intended to float balloons off so that the reports could see their position. The 30 foot crux of the climb comes directly above this ledge. Huge route with great exposure. Like any Conn route its an adventure and takes good route finding skills. I found myself off route at times. The route ascends the Nose of Little Devils Tower. Climb up gully systems to gain the Balloon Ledge. Short face crux pitch leads to more gully systems above the ledge. Easier ledges and gullies lead to the summit. Summit pitch should end around the old spruce tree atop. There route for the most part has been lost. Try to follow up what information has been given. As stated before I got way off route.

I would argue that Spearfish Canyon Climbing can be broken up into three, maybe four eras. The Pre-Junek era took place when I was in high school in the early nineties. This was when wide-eyed, bushy tailed kids like Greg Parker, Nate Renner and myself were running around Spearfish Canyon without any real purpose in life until we met Pete deLannoy. Our small, rag-tag group of newly annointed climbing enthusiasts had no idea that other stellar climbing locals, like Skeletal Remains, existed in our backyard. Then Pete took us to Mohican and our teenage souls experienced a whole new level of stoke and confidence.  ", "  I did a two year stint at BHSU during what was known as the \"Old School Age of Development\". Scrawny, strong-dudes, like Mike Cronin, and Blake Workmen, were starting to come into their own. After I finally got a redpoint on a hard 5.8 known as The Joker, I announced I was trading in my rope for a surfboard, and Cronin told me they were going to \"bolt the whole planet.\" I told them good luck with that and proceeded to spend a decade in another part of the planet.  ", "  When I returned to Spearfish, a new era, \"The Yellowbook Era\" was in full swing and everyone was running around with Bruce Junek's yellow bible, hopping on the well versed routes on the Mohican Wall, the Sunshine Wall and a crazy place called Blue Sky. Myself, and about a dozen other local climbers played catch-up on The Sunshine Wall, thanks to the moderate classics bolted by Mike McNeil. Then, one magical day, the floodgate opened for those of us, who had been looking over our shoulders, while climbing the Big Black Face. We laced our hiking boots up tight and wandered over to the Northern Shores of Spearfish Creek and found newly bolted lines with hand scrawled plaques at their bases. These routes were being put up by brave, young men, who after graduating from BHSU, decided to make their own climbing scene since they had climbed every climb in Junek's yellow book ten times over and, in their wide-open minds, a new frontier had to be claimed and converted to Canyon Christendom. ", "  This \"New Skool\" era broke out of the primordial ooze and some of us newly painted die-hards began running around the far reaches of the upper canyon penciling in these New Skool climbs in our thin, yellow guidebooks. In addition to new areas, new routes started popping up next to old classic lines. It soon became apparent that these New Skool developers, like Jamie Coin and Lee Terveen, had taken Pete's torch and were running wild with it setting Spearfish Canyon ablaze with radically fun, hard as hell routes like \"Peace Pipe\" and \"Plastered Bastard\". Once the yellow book became obsolete, word of mouth was your only hope, and we, the locals, met in dank watering holes telling each other about our newest projects that we were trying to redpoint. We became the ultimate climbing hipsters describing routes that had bolts so new they had not a scratch on them and the holes were still steaming from Lee and Jamie's prolific drill bits. We, the locals, prided ourselves in the cloak of secrecy and giggled at Minnisota climbers, who had no clue of the gems Spearfish Canyon truly held,as they thumbed their way though that highly sought after yellow book. ", "  This New Skool era of child-like joy and discovery lasted longer than it should have because rumors of a \"new guidebook\" just kept getting older and dustier as a supposed publication date kept get putting pushed farther and farther into an uncertain future. Then one day, Mike Cronin made good on his promise and the new guidebook came just in time for Christmas and the Post-Cronin era came into being. And guess what? A select few of us are still penciling in new routes into the Cronin book, giggling behind your backs and saying things like, \"If you like this climb, then you should try this NEW one.\" The Joneses keep sprinting ahead. Just admit to yourself that there is no hope in keeping up.              ", "  Buffalo Gap is an example of classic, old school route. It has continuously challenged me and kept me in shape for many years. It stands out in my book as a must do since it helped make it possible to get strong for all these New Skool lines that have popped into existence over the years.
