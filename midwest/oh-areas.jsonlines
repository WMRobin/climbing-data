Now, extensions have been added such that 4 more short routes can also be topped out, with some very cool and quite tricky lower-angle climbing on the upper sections. The extensions are listed as separate routes, and the lower anchors are all still in place.\u00a0Note: For routes with permadraws, please be sure to hang your own draw on the 1st bolt.
