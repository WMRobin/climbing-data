Folks have been climbing the ledgy faces and slabs here via rock climbing and dry tooling approaches for decades. Earliest known climbing was sometime after World War 2, most likely not really starting until the 1960's.  ", "  The Muskrat Love Wall has a series of diagonal cracks rising from bottom right to upper left, which cut through the big quarried ledge systems. Several vertical routes ascend the wall cutting through these and, although they are all relatively similar in appearance, have distinctly different character depending on whether you rock climb vs. dry tool them. No to be missed dry tool routes are the line on the far right ascending the ar\u00eate, sticking mostly to its left face, and the route affectionately referred to as \"The Crucifix\" - approximately the second from the left bolted route (where a starting move of two opposing side pulls puts you into a crucified position to get up to a drill hole to the upper right.  ", "  In the mid-point of the first decade of the 21st century, the wall was retrobolted by Mike Endrizzi and friends. This provides an assortment of moderate leads including fixed anchors, which can be carefully accessed from the top via an easy walk up the backside (riverside) of the cliff band, for top roping. Be very careful when leading these routes as there are ample opportunities for ledge-falls should you blow a clip or fall just short of the clip. Therefore, if you are new to leading, know that a 5.8 or 5.9 here has much more dire consequences than on other routes of the same grade ascending smooth, ledgeless faces. When top roping, use quickdraws in the anchors rather than running your rope through the fixed gear so as to reduce their wear and tear. Similarly, when dry tooling, refrain from hooking the fixed anchors, not that you'd ever dream of doing so in the first place. This rarely happens, but it's worth mentioning as the anchors are fixed glue-ins and nearly impossible to replace."], "location": [" "], "path": "Sandstone|Sandstone Ice Park|Sax Wall", "us_state": "Minnesota", "url": "https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106916026/sax-wall", "lnglat": [-94.5703, 45.89], "metadata": {"lnglat_from_parent": false}}

It is in the shade in the morning and is always cooler because it is right next to the river making it a great spot when the Minnesota and Wisconsin strips are baking in direct sun. Top rope setup is very easy and the climbs are good so the only thing you are compromising is height.

There is a rock in the river that you can belay from if yo umust belay from below, but beware of passing boats creating wake. ", "  The down river side features a nice large, shaded ledge to belay from and sit on while watching friends climb; the ledge is easily visible when you look over the edge of the face. The most direct way to access the ledge is to rappel off the top; but there is also an easy scramble/walk route up/down from the ledge; I cannot explain it but it is easy to figure out if you just head up the ledge and you will find your way.
