Peter Monkkonen, Richard Doege and Brian McKinley", "description": ["The most spectacular, and may I add, the only spectacular natural icefall in Minnesota. A must-do for any Minnesota ice climber. A significant part of the Nightfall experience is a unique hike along the frozen and meandering Devil's Track River enclosed within reddish walls of a steep ravine. Grade may vary depending on conditions but the top section is most often WI 4. Nightfall is relatively wide so several variations usually exist.Pitch 1: Start from the river bank and climb over a short steep section leading into a wider snowy bowl at the bottom of the main flow. Ice conditions rarely permit a belay setup at the bottom of the bowl (a bad spot for falling ice anyway), most of the time you need to suck it up and set up an anchor where the ice gets steeper.Pitch 2: Go up the steep flow to a small rest, most years there will be two options from here: a center finish to a moss/mug/gravel top-out, or a left finish with a bulge-pull and a delicate sphagnum/snow move to reach the anchor.\u00a0For a one-pitch lead (highly recommended for enjoyment and safety!) a pair of 70m ropes and long runners will get you to the tree anchor on top. If you are using 60s, 5-10m of simul-climbing is required to reach to proper tree. 2021 Rappel/Anchor Tree Update: The obvious tree at the top of the climb has recently seen some serious erosion. Scrolling through photos posted by climbers in the last 10-15 years on this page, it's easy to notice the difference in how this climb forms nowadays. There was once a time when belaying and rappelling from this tree was the clear choice. Now, with more roots and loose rocks being exposed ever year, the stance below this tree has all but fallen away and it's better to top out and use the tree 20 feet directly back from the edge. To prevent further erosion, use the extended rappel anchor (new as of Jan. 2021 and bomer!) that should be within arms reach of the comfortable stance just above the obvious tree at the top of the climb. A pair of 60s juuuust gets you down from here, there may be a couple moves of downclimbing on easy terrain to get you all the way to the river. 70s should be no problem. \u00a0\u00a0Reference: \"Ice Climbs of the Lake Superior Region\", Granite Publishing"], "location": ["From Grand Marais drive north on Hwy 61 for about 2 miles until you see the bridge over Devil Track River (sign).

The entire first pitch including the hard climbing protects very well.\u00a0.Some fine print on this logistical nightmare:This route is a lot of work before you even start climbing. \u00a0Whether you are TRing or leading, you need to get to a belay ledge that is 2 feet off the water and 20ft in from a plumb line rappel under a big roof. For TR you HAVE to have directionals (or you could fall into the lake) so you horizontal/down aid while rappelling, clipping pro for directionals.\u00a0If leading it makes sense to do 2 pitches and end the pitch at the mid route ledge as your rope drag is getting pretty heinous due to the roof and subsequent traverse to the ledge. Originally led as one pitch with some double rope shenanigans.Best Logistics for Top RopingTR solo is a must due to, rope stretch with low crux, mega rope drag, and lack of communication with the top. \u00a0Rap down the upper dihedral (no directionals needed) to the obvious ledge. Move out right to the steep/slightly over hanging dihedral. Place a .3 at head height and rebelay/clove hitch this piece to reduce rope stretch through the low crux. Continue placing a couple more directionals down this over hanging dihedral. Once you reach the horizontal roof you will need to aid across it and eventually down the steep fist crack clipping your rope to pieces for directionals as you go. If someone else is TRing after you, leaving pieces in place makes it much easier for subsequent climbers. Doubles .3-3 needed for directionals.\u00a0Best Logistics for LeadBoat approach: Yep this is the easiest way. There is a small parking lot off of Highway 61 about a half mile north of Palisade where you can walk a canoe or raft down to the lake and paddle south.\u00a0Rappel approach: Getting to the belay ledge for leading is a bit easier than for TR since you don't need to place directionals and can go on the left side of the roof which is a little smaller. There are some slight variations to this, but this will likely be the easiest. Rap down do the obvious ledge at the bottom of the dihedral. Set an anchor here and pull your rope. Then do the following1. Fix one end of your rope to the anchor and start rappelling hard left.\u00a02.Place a .75 in a horizontal crack on the left side of a small dihedral at the same level as the belay ledge you just left and clip your rappel line to this as a directional (you will be able to reach down and get this from the belay ledge later).\u00a02.Rap down until slightly below some obvious jugs on the left side of the chimney and the fixed nut (see pics). Tension traverse in using side pull crimps and eventually the good jugs to reach a fixed nut with a carabiner on it. Easiest to PAS to the nut and then pull slack to clip your rap line.\u00a03. Lower down level with belay ledge while swinging in. or tension traversing in the chimney. Have some cams ready to place for your anchor. \u00a0Set anchor on the ledge using .1-.4 cams.\u00a0You have used less than 25m of rope to get down there, so you will use the remaining part of your rope to lead up the right side of the roof. Once back at your anchor, end the pitch and untie the fixed end and your belayer can pull the rope down through the fixed nut to retrieve your rope and you can reach down to clean the .75. You could also double rope rappel in and pull your rope if you want a much more committing experience. Also definitely use a gri when tension traversing in, its a 2 handed affair.

There are certainly some harder climbs at the bluff, but none personify so well the nature of hard climbing at Red Wing; incredibly crimpy, super technical, and very temperature dependent.  The first 50 feet are incredibly sustained, with no real letup until you reach the jug at bolt six; from there to the top is relatively easy 5.10 climbing with ample opportunity to depump before sneaking through the band of choss on top to reach the anchors.  The bottom two thirds of the route consists of three very difficult boulder problems, each one harder than the last, linked by easier but extremely technical terrain.  The first powerful, crimpy boulder problem gets you to the second bolt and the bottom of the distinctive seam/crack that diagonals up the lower part of the wall.  The seam consists of super techy 5.11+ that may seem impossible until you find the right sequence of microscopic footholds to see you through.  At the end of the seam, the next boulder problem tackles a powerful gaston and match on a slopey rail to reach the large pocket which is much worse than it looks.  Make the difficult clip from the pocket, then move left to reach the \"rest\" at a four inch long, incut crimper.  I would not consider this a rest on any other route, but you take what you can get and this is far and away the best hold between the ground and the jug at 50 feet.  Shake out as best you can before tackling another ten feet of awkward, technical 5.11 climbing to reach the ultimate crux of the route and the hardest individual moves, right after the fifth bolt.  There are numerous sequences for the last boulder problem, but they invariably all use the same razor sharp 1/4 inch crimper, tiny iron oxide gaston high and right, and some combination of worthless ripples and pockets as intermediates to reach the flat, positive crimper that finishes this V5 sequence.  Bearing down on the sharp holds enough to stick the last moves as your forearms reach meltdown is, needless to say, a good test of pain tolerance and tenacity.  Two more big reaches will bring you to that \"thank god\" jug out right and the end of the difficulties.  Due to the thin, crimpy nature of this route, it's highly temperature dependent and nearly impossible during the humid summer months.
