There are even more variations than I will post here, but I am sharing all of what I think are the 'true' routes on the boulder.The great thing about this rock is you can more or less climb into any of the other routes at most points in time.With this (and other) sandstone, it is best to wait at least 36 hours after it rains to avoid breaking holds - and for better friction. The routes on the main boulder have been thoroughly climbed and the holds seem fairly solid, but it would probably be wise to avoid any crazy dynos to small holds.There is probably more rock in Wildcat State Park somewhere, but a lot of what I have seen is too sandy and brittle.

{"area_name": "Bob's Rock", "description": ["Bob's Rock a.k.a Marengo Creek Bluff is a red granite slab leftover from the ancient Penokee Mountain Range. Millions of years of erosion and glaciers have left the scenic hills that border the southern end of the Marengo Valley and stretch over to the U.P.. Bob's is on the Southeast side of the Marengo River and across the valley from the Old Swedish Settlement trail. It is almost visible from Juniper Rock Outlook. Rumors exist about climbing other cliffs in the valley although none of the other faces have ever been developed. The cliff face is approx. 70 feet tall with some easy to moderate climbing. There are currently four pairs of bolts for TR anchors with an access trail that locals sometimes hike for the view. Locals will also frequent the area scavenging for wild ramps when they are in season and occasionally the parking area will be shared with local fishermen.The earliest ascents claimed at the crag were by Burton Lindquist in the 70s and 80s. The bluff was rediscovered in the late 90s. In 1997 Ryan Eddingfield, a Northland College student at the time scouted the cliff and spent the summer cleaning the face and developing the access trail. Ryan first introduced the name Bob Rock and now it goes by Bob's Rock, or Marengo Creek Bluff. Northland College has been using the bluff for outdoor classes ever since and in 2001 student John J. Roeder developed a short guidebook titled Marengo Creek Bluff as part of a class assignment. The college still has a PDF copy. There appear to be 6-7 original routes established in the summer of 97 although their exact locations and names are a matter of some discrepancy and guess work over the years.EMERGENCY:\u00a0Phone service is terrible to non-existent so plan accordingly. First responders will be local volunteer firefighters and EMTs.
