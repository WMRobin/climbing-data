{"area_name": "Donut Shop, The", "description": ["A superb summer and fall crag with a stout approach hike that clocks in at nearly an hour. The Donut Shop has a handful of really good routes with potential for many more exciting and tasty lines. Climbers, who are hungry for adventurous sport climbing, will get a chance to snack on a mixture of steep, bulgy slab climbing and blonde power endurance pocket fests. The routes are fairly long and located on bullet-proof black and yellow rock that sports really good holds. Expect to hike mostly in the sun through a mind-blowing, National Geographic-like nature setting. After getting an advanced cardiovascular workout, get ready for an all day feast of fabulous cragging.

If you want to climb at The Donut Shop Turn right at The Big Leblondski wall and walk in a westerly direction for one more minute. Most of The Donut Shop routes are on a black wall with patches of blonde. Past this mostly black wall is a yellow buttress with a group of hard 5.12 climbs on it.

", "  The Donut Shop, and its neighbors, are probably the closet thing to a locals only crag that Spearfish Canyon offers. Getting invited by a resident climber, who knows the area, is the best way to enjoy these crags. Their remote location and strange weather windows have ensured these crags to be places where solitude is utterly guaranteed.

From there it will not take very long for you to find a flat four-wheel drive road that lies parallel to an old timey pipeline. This manmade structure is often covered by mosses, grass, and dirt but it is very noticable and obvious to the eye. NOTE! This road is closed to vehicle traffic, although authorized crew members take vehicles on it so that they may maintain and inspect the pipeline. For those of you familiar with The Shadowlands and the Darkside, this is that same pipeline of historical yore which still provides the city of Lead with water.", " After locating the old timey pipe, hike back towards the Hanna Campground (the one you pay to stay at) for about 8 to 10 minutes.
