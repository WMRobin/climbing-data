This trail (actually a power-line access road) parallels the right side of the field. When the field ends, turn left, then right again at the next power-line. The trail from the power line to the cliff cuts off left a bit before the power line drops downhill (see the photo). Later, an elaborate cairn marks a smaller trail branching right from the main trail. \u00a0This smaller trail meets the cliff directly over the middle of the Main Face, continues left, and eventually zigzags down to the bottom.

These routes -- including Fist Fight, Tennessee, Double Overhead Cam, Leave it to Beaver, Rikert's Corner, and Ben's Boot -- have been given these names -- the names that Al and his programs used in the mid-1970's -- on an \"Also Known As\" (\"aka\") basis in this online guide, with modern route names used first, in order to make it easier for today's visitors to find these routes.

If you bring your dog to the crag, please use the Northfield Mountain Visitor Center parking lot for access to Rose.
