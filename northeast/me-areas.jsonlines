Gorham Bike and Ski runs weekly MTB rides and can help you find new trails (facebook.com/gbssaco/)", " ***Clifford Park has a bad reputation for trash, broken glass, and the occasional squatter. Just be safe, pick up some trash if you can, and have a great time!", " ROCK HISTORY The rocks follow two main granite veins which cross the park East to West. These granite rocks were part of a multitude of quarries dating back to the 1800s. The largest collection of mines belonged to the Andrews Quarries which were most active in 1886. Biddeford granite was used in construction of the military forts near Portland, the Lincoln Monument in Illinois, and multiple bridge foundations in NYC. There is frequent quarry / mining evidence throughout the park and it makes for some fun climbing around blocky slabs of forgotten quarries.

It started at a clearing with good views of the cliff, on the left. You followed yellow/red blazes through the woods and boulder field (which had cairns) and led straight to the cliff and start of the routes.\" Thanks for the update Ron.  ", "   Since I climbed here about 20 years ago much has changed. Knees are older and the trail has eroded more. (Hurricane Irene?)  ", "     Yup, the Loop Trail is STEEP...Yup, where the abandoned trail veered off left at the \"viewing ledges\" [now the \"climber's path\"] 1/3 of the way up the Mtn is now grown in. The 2nd half of the \"Loop Trail\" is the continuously steepest trail I have ever done in 65 years of hiking. Only the Class3 ascent of Chimney Peak from the Pamola-ChimneyPeak gap comes close, and that was dry and short.  ", "Let us now continue with Bradly White's excellent description, annotated with 2017 undates...]", " Tumbledown Mt. is a massif mountain with three distinctive peaks West, East and North. The West Peak is gotten to by the Loop Trail. It's a strenuous hike. Below its summit is the 700+ granite cliff that is known as the Great Ledge by hikers. It has had a large recent rock slide. Not problematic to rock climbing. ", "    The ledge is about 400ft and then a large tree band. After the trees there are many shorter sections of cliff below this summit that start as overhangs and steep corner chimneys before they're slab finishes.  The main lower ledge has a steep slab section on it's western side.  The central section is a giant v groove with tree band ledges and a series of overhangs are on it's eastern side. [2017 Note- It looks as if there's been a major rockfall in this \"central section\". RHall Admin. The climbs \"AMC Route\" and \"AMC Direct\" are significantly left of the obvious orange-colored rock scar left by this rockfall.]  Far to the west of this ledge is another ledge that is shorter, approximately 300ft and mostly steep slab that terminates below the summit in forest. [2017 NOTE- I think that Bradly is talking about the \"southwest slab(s)\" when he says \"far to the west\". I think he means even far west of the old chimney hiking route that was abandoned about 20 years ago after rockfall there destroyed its iron rungs. ]  ", "     The East Peak isn't as high as 700ft of cliff but it isn't short either, possibly 500ft of uninterrupted rock climbing on it's most western side. The base of this wall is reached by the Brook trail. The central and eastern side of the East Peak are slab bands divided by tall trees. A rock climber below will just have to go up route finding as they go because below this peak the slab visualization is blocked by trees except the furthest western edge. When the brook begins to be seen on the trail about 1 mile up head west and the base will become noticeable. ", "      The North Peak has no trail to it. From the summit of the East Peak it is easily approached. The southwestern slab has the only decent climbing on it, possibly 200ft. Quite easy after getting past the initial short steep start to gain the slab section. ", "     There has been little to no activity on this mountain. There was an old A.M.C. climb but I believe it is mostly gone from the rock slide. [2017 Note- The AMC \"Routes\" are still intact, unaffected by either the rockfall of 20-25 years ago on the \"chimney hiking trail\" or the rockfall that created the orange scar. R Hall Admin.]   ", "    The approach to the Great Ledges and summit cliffs must be endured before the technical climbing begins. It is a steep couple of miles of steep hiking up the Loop Trail. [2017 Note- Actually, it is a couple of miles, but the first half of the trail is essentially flat, thus making the 2nd half even steeper. It is REALLY STEEP, think: \"Wildcat A\" from Carter Notch, or Huntington Ravine Trail\". That being said, the upper half of the \"Loop Trail\" between the flat, open ledges and the summit area is even steeper!  This UPPER HALF CAN NOT BE RECOMMENDED AS A DESCENT ROUTE WITH PACKS AND GEAR. RHall Admin.]    ", "    Tumbledown Mt. is not a true Alpine condition mountain but it is not an off the road excursion either. Summer climbing should always be safe from Albinism conditions because the summit is in the 3000ft range and bad weather approaching can be seen at a great distance. The rest of the year climbers should be prepared for the worst weather possible. Because of its location the environment is similar to the N.H. White Mountains environment before above tree line and above Cannon Cliff. ", "   Basically the forest between cliff is gnarly pine trees.  ", "    The Mt. Blue Campground is nearby at Webb Lake.

", "The Rock:", "  Very large grained granite (pegmatite?), typically consisting of 0.5-3\u201d quartz and feldspar crystals. This results in surprisingly solid, highly textured, knobby faces with irregular cracks. The rock lacks the sort of grain that creates the nice predictable features typical of finer grained granite. The upper middle-right area of the cliff does have a large fine grained intrusion with attractive looking rock, but it doesn\u2019t tend to have any cracks or features to climb. Surprisingly difficult and runout. The main areas are quite interesting, generally protectable, and varied.  ", "The Weather:", "  C Bluff is generally 5-10F degrees colder than Conway NH. Because it faces due south, the sun shines but a west wind really rips over the pond and funnels through the valley at the foot of the bluff. Bugs are on par with most of New England, mosquitoes not so bad, but flies and ticks can be thick. Climbing before or after the leaves are out is recommended. I wouldn\u2019t go there if the forecast is warmer than 80F. ", "Wildlife Refuge:", "  C Bluff is on the east end of the Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge. It is home to several small rare plants, birds, and of course the peregrine falcon. The peregrines roost on a disconnected portion of the cliff, located to the west. The only route that may be too close (within \u00bc mile) would be The High C\u2019s. We did climb it in the summer and were not harassed by the birds. Either way, these birds need to be left alone until late August. You know the drill. Check out the state summary. ", "Access:", "  The cliff and pond are most likely owned by logging companies. Typically these companies allow access for recreation, including climbing, but do not permit such things as camping, fires, or obstructing logging equipment. The area also falls within the Wildlife Refuge, which also allows access for recreation. On the drive in, before the gate, there is currently much logging activity so watch for trucks and machinery. To preserve access, please tread lightly.

View the map I\u2019ve made here;usp=sharing, which hopefully you can load in Google Maps and follow on your phone.

At the sand pit, take a left and continue riding along a grassy logging road as it zigzags towards the cliff. Stay LEFT at any intersections until the road stops about 200ft from the pond. Ditch the bikes here. Follow the heavily overgrown logging road up and to the RIGHT for about 300ft, then turn LEFT and head straight for the cliff and into the woods. At this point, the idea is to follow faint deer/climber trail as it crosses the stream and stays 50ft to the left of the boulder field.Trail Details: You'll quickly descend into a streambed, which is crossed to find a lonely truck sized boulder. At the boulder, head straight up hill, staying to the left of a slight ravine and the overgrown boulder field, following intermittent deer trails. After 10 minutes and about 200ft from the cliff, head diagonally RIGHT over a couple rocks to the toe of the cliff.
