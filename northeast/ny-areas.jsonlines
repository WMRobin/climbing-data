{"area_name": "Mud Pond", "description": ["Located to the southeast of the rest of the climbing in the Silver Lake area, this cliff gets its name from the pond that lies nearby.", "It has a mellow 25 minute approach.There are few moderates here, and every route that is at least two stars is 5.9 and up. Highly rated options in the 5.10 and 5.11 range are numerous, and it also boasts two of the hardest routes in the park thanks to the efforts of Peter Kamitses: Moonshine and Chronic (5.13+), and The Sword of Deception (5.13).Regarding \"sun and bugs\". This is one of the better cliffs to chase sun or shade. It curves around in an arc from roughly E/SE to W/SW (see satellite image above). In general, the R end will get early sun, and the left will see sun till much later. Even better, the cliff face takes many zigs and zags and the big corners and nooks will find earlier or later sun or shade depending on their aspect. On bugs-yes the black flies can be brutal here and the deer flies occasionally annoying. Just like any other ADK cliff in a non-treated area. Early to mid-May is usually the time to stay away depending on the hatch. The good thing is that the bugs \"will tell you\" that it is a good day to leave and go to Poke-O instead within a few minutes of leaving your rig... However, by mid June or so \"pas de problem\". If there is a bit of breeze summer is really good here. And April is great, before the trees leaf-makes locating stuff from a distance much easier too.\u00a0Finally, a note on \"sectors\". The cliff can be roughly thought of as having 4 sections. The approach trail will lead you to a dramatic amphitheater with steep clean white/pink rock on it's left side and a left-angling full length dike rock chimney on the right margin. There are no trees growing near the base in this amphitheater. It is dominated by an old Beaman/Lazarnick route, Born To Run, up an impressive thin crack/flake on the left side. To the left of this area, the cliff goes into the woods and stretches several hundred feet with a typical backwoods feel. There is a good deer trail along the base, and a mix of low roofs guarding high corners with some slab faces mixed in. One recorded route here. Easy walk to top from this end. Heading right from Born To Run is a long section of cliff that zigs and zags, featuring corners, aretes, faces, and many cracks. The majority of routes at Mud Pond are in this \"central\" section, and currently are mainly in the 9 to 11 range. It has the best mix of crack climbing at the entire Silver Lake complex-several would be among the best of their grade at The Web. There is a good trail along the base, and it's a pleasant place to be-the woods are near, but not up hard against the cliff. Heading right from this central section, the cliff changes character, becoming (much) steeper with perfect pink rock streaked with black intrusions. This section is also anchored by another beautiful Beaman route-Gizmo, a handcrack through an intimidating bulge of perfect rock. The section is also home to some impressive and jaw dropping 13's by another Vermonter Peter Kamitses. Don't gawk to long at this section or you will strain your neck, it's that continuously steep. The cliff band ends a few hundred feet right of here, but not before passing a few clean and stiff looking sport routes in the 11 range, by Frank Minunn, etc. Somewhat trashy but easy to top from this end.

{"area_name": "Center of Progress Cliff", "description": ["This is another great Silver Lake cliff. A short approach, great rock, and some routes that are among the best in the Park hare a few of the reasons to check it out. The cliff has a mix of trad, sport, and mixed pitches, typically one or two pitches. The cliff really shines in the 5.10 grade, and I consider it a must-visit for the 5.10 Adirondack climber.   Some highlights are:   Connecticut Yankee, two pitches of crack climbing equal in quality to Hard Times at Moss Cliff. The first pitch (10+) features a strenuous undercling out an arch, into a wide flake. Hands around a roof lead to a comfy belay ledge. The 2nd pitch (10-) starts (very) thin crack off the belay for 50' on perfect black rock. Continue up cracks and corners past a final roof to the top.   Ken Nichols got the FFA in 1984, the grades are solid....   Adirondack Iron, an approach pitch (9-) climbs a crack in a groove to a great belay ledge. P2 (5.10) is incredible face climbing up a broad shield of perfect rock with a steep and climatic finish. This is the best 5.10 pitch I've done  on any cliff at Silver Lake-spectacular.   Other must do routes for the 5.10 climber are, from R to L:   Rock Hangers, 1p (5.10)-steep crack on interesting rock   Tiguidou Pack-Sack, 1p (9+) steep undulating corner   Objects In Motion, 2p (5.10 A0, 5.10-) climb p1 of Ct. Yankee to ledge. A few points of aid to corners, crack, and a hard mantle.   red, black & blue, 2p (10+, 10) deceptively hard face climbing to a steeper and thinner face on p1, a ramp to corner, then face crux on p2   Do The Evolution, 1p (5.10) climb P1 of Silver Flake to a belay. Follow Silver Flake p2 for 15', step left onto slab. Face climbing to a steep crux corner. Finish up flakes and slashing cracks in a slab.   Wasted Reprise, 1p (5.10) Climb past the p1 belay of Silver Flake to a two bolt belay. Climb the left arching crack/flake that is surprisingly off balance. Enter a true heel and toe off width that has a hidden crack inside for gear, no wide pro needed. Exit right to a shared belay with Do the Evolution.   Quercus Rubra, 2p (9+, 9+) Two varied pitches-sport bolted face/slab to a two bolt anchor). P2 starts easy runout up and right to hands in a perfect corner. When the corner ends, steep face climbing leads to a tricky wide groove, and a final slab.   Tooth & Nail, 2p (10/10+, 5.7) Thin crack to a flawless corner.   There are many other worthwhile climbs in harder and easier grades. Moderates worth seeking out are:    Rolls Royce, 1p (5.7+). Interesting face to a steep crack finish, shared anchor w/ Tiguidou Pack-Sack.   BruisedOrange, 1p (5.7) Closely bolted sport climbing starts in a corner, makes a cool pull around an arete, and finishes on a featured low angle face."], "location": ["As you drive in on Turnpike road there are several spots where you can pull over and get a great view of the Silver Lake cliffs, lined up along the ridgeline.

With a good eye and common sense, none of the cliffs at Silver Lake are particularly difficult to locate, or strenuous to approach. COP happens to be about the easiest approach of them all. The brush, \"rutted logging roads\", and bugs on the approaches have been overstated as well. The logging roads can be a help or hindrance-fast open travel, or annoying slash and debris. Luckily, most of the woods are open hardwoods. Simply step into the woods around any annoying spots. Yes, there can be bugs, occasionally like a bad Wallface day. The majority of the time, however, no different than elsewhere. Wear long pants and light colored clothing.   Park at the Turnpike Rd. Trailhead (pg. 438 Adk Rock Vol #2, \"girl book\").

Go more or less straight left from there for a few hundred yards, then contour gradually up and left along skidded paths and open hardwoods toward the left end of COP.  Previously, the best approach was to contour left a few hundred yards further, and then go straight up through the hardwoods past cairns to arrive at CT Yankee. The logging, however, has left a mess of the final contour. Allow 40 minutes for your first visit, or contact a friendly local.

The climbing is single pitch with a mix of crack and face climbing up to 100'. The cliff features a bit of everything: thin technical face climbing, roof pulling, hand cracks, OW cracks and even a full length chimney. All climbs have two bolt anchors.I would expect to run into a party or two on nice weather weekends but, as with most Adk crags, I wouldn't expect to ever see a crowd.The rock quality is very good. Solid and grippy similar to nearby Lost T cliff. Many of the routes are still a little bit dirty, but should clean up with some more traffic. I would say bring a wire brush to be on the safe side.

We have named the cliff after her; you will not see this name on other maps.McMartin is a fabulous cliff (or series of cliffs) and will eventually probably have 40 or 50 climbs on it. As an added benefit, climbs should be available in a range of skill levels, including the modest 5.7 to 5.9 range. McMartin is a maze of ar\u00eates, dihedrals, cracks, spires, roofs, ceilings and faces at both positive and negative angles, so any type of climb you like should be there. The longest climbs will probably be about 160 ft. As of August 2010 there were 9 completed climbs.

For the first part of the approach the existing path to Lost Hunter was used; an additional path of length 1.2 km(.75 mi) was laid out.

The only reason to take the blue trail would be if the lake ice is not safe, but if you're here to ice climb, that's extremely unlikely.GPS will help you locate the ice crag (555795, 4789816) and Arctic Cat.

Wise climbers will include a topo map in their inventory.   For the purposes of this route catalogue, this area includes all the ice routes that lie east of and are not accessible via the hiker's trails. A few routes that therefore lie on the eastern end of the  southwest flank are included here.   Access for many of the routes is facilitated by an unofficial, but popular climber's path affectionately called the BAW path (for \"Black Arches Wall\"). However, for the most popular ice route on Crane Mtn., the Waterfall Wall, climbers generally leave this path when it begins climbing toward the Measles Walls, instead holding the contour along the base for another quarter mile, then cutting upslope to meet the Little Ravine, crossing it to gain Parallel Ridge, and then following this down to its base, where the classic ice line lies. This same route should be taken for all climbs that lie past the Waterfall Wall as well.   That approach takes about an hour, depending on routefinding skills, trail conditions, etc. Note that several excellent ice climbs lie well past the Waterfall Wall, as much as another half-hour walk.

The angle of the walls is quite varied, with several slabs, vertical walls, and steep overhangs.Leading: Only a handful of routes accept good gear for leading. The rock is generally very solid, and holds gear well. Other than top anchors, not there are no protection bolts on Moss Island.Toproping: Many of the routes have top bolts for anchors on Moss Island. \u00a0You'll need long webbing to set up climbs since many of the bolts are at least 1'-4' back from the edge. Access to the top is easily gained at either end of the cliff, or via one of the many 3rd class ascent/descent routes along the wall.Routes range from 5.0 to 5.12c, with everything in between. That said, sandbagging is a bit of a tradition here. Every inch of this wall has been climbed at some point or another, don't even think about a first ascent. The now out-of-print guidebook lists around 100 named routes; some good, some bad, some incredibly contrived. A new digital guidebook written by Gary Thomann details 81 routes with full-color zoom-able photos/lines and GPS-enabled maps, and is available in the Gunks+ app. Good and popular routes of various grades include:Jeff Loves Eileen (5.4)The Thinker (5.7)Older but Weissner (5.8)Sno-White (5.8)The Dreamer (5.9)Curbar Edge (5.9)Triple Overhang (5.10a)Fool's Overture (5.10a)Fred P.

{"area_name": "Dihedrals, The", "description": ["Be sure to read the access warning, as some/most routes have been stripped.The Dihedrals is a perfect example of making do with what you have. In the rock starved NYS Thruway corridor, this crag is your best option for leading and pushing your limits on harder routes. Admittedly, the atmosphere of the crag is horrible, the railroad tracks are very close to the base of the crag. After a recent train derailment, the buffer of trees between the tracks and the crag has been removed. When you can't get to the Dacks or Gunks this crag will fill your fancy though. Climb here enough and you will learn to love the smell of railroad ties and tune out the rumble of passing trains.In the out-of-print guide for Little Falls, \"The Dihedrals\" refers to the tallest, right most section of the uninterrupted cliff line on the right side of the abandoned factory. Each section of the cliff was given it's own name. The crag really isn't that big, so today we refer to this entire area as \"The Dihedrals\".None of the routes here are more than 65ft in height. While the routes may seem short, they are the some of the longest in Little Falls. Most of the routes are pretty clean with the exception of Cotter's Corner. The rock type is metasyenite, similar to granite, but lower in quality. In some sections of the cliff the rock has a smooth black finish which makes it very hot in the summer. Other sections of the cliff bare a slight resemblance to Keene Valley area crags like The Barkeater Cliff or Pitchoff Chimney Cliff. Overall the rock quality is pretty good, I would take this crag over the popular limestone choss of the Niagara Escarpment any day. Surprisingly, this crag doesn't see much traffic, people would rather spend 20 mins setting up a TR to climb a 20'-tall face on Moss Island.The routes themselves are diverse, ranging from 5.4-5.12+. The crag has an array of cracks which take great gear on lead. Over the past few years, modern, bolted face climbs have been established. Some of the climbs can be TRed by walking around to the right side of the cliff, others must be lead on bolts or gear.

", "  The next major wall, just past the roof of Jean, is the Drunkard's Delight wall, which continues with a low overhang. Drunkard's Delight has a remarkably \"bouldery\" start, and follows a crack to a (hysterically fun) roof.  ", "  Past the right end of the head-height overhang, you'll find the huge right-facing corner of Easy Street, and the major arch of, you guessed it, Arch; downhill from that route, you'll find a low arete, Ribs, which marks the start of the next section, d. Strictly - The Ceiling. ", "  Mixing it up above the GT ledge is a worthwhile option here.  Between Frog's Head and Morning After, you have the option of finishing on the last pitch of Maria, a classic \"5.6\" roof; either last pitch of Sixish (5.4 or 5.10); Drunkard's very nice 5.5 corner; the 5.4 last pitch of Sixish; or the 5.9 corner-roof of Arc of a Diver, all within an easy walk on the GT ledge.

", "  There are two sets of rappel bolts at the GT Ledge on the Frog's Head Wall: above City Lights (also useful for Son of Easy O and Pas de Deux), and just to the right of Frog's Head (also for Sundown and Maria).  Above Baby, a tree with rappel rings is best to avoid using, due to the plethora of pebbles and the likelyhood of unaware parties below. Mid-cliff, there are anchors for Easy Overhang, City Lights and Frog's Head that are also easily accessed from neighboring routes.
