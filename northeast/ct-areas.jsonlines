Visit this crag when it's warm and it will resemble a vertical, green jungle. You'\u0092ll find great conditions here after a week or more of below-freezing temperatures with at least a couple inches of snow on the ground. A nor'easter will makes things fat and a warm day can tear the ice down. The cliff is north-northwest facing and gets afternoon sun through the trees. Short ice screws and/or rock gear are necessary to protect most routes. Bring a delicate mindset.Like most of the area, the rock is great; however, it can be friable and very coarse (mind your rope). There is currently no fixed protection on the cliff, so on new routes please place bolts only where they're absolutely necessary as most of this cliff provides ample natural gear opportunities. Trees are available for anchors above every route; however, if CT climbers deem this a worthwhile crag, bolted anchors may be a good idea to protect vegetation and ropes. There are two other good cliffs in the park. When conditions are good I imagine it would be worth up to a 1- to 1.5-hour drive.Routes (from Right>Left)-The Tube (WI4): A short but eye-catching ice route that\u0092s usually no wider or thicker than body-width. Short and easy rock finish. Forms consistently.-Give Me The Cure (WI4 M4): Ice just left of the Tube and finish at the top of the cliff. Mixed finish through awkward horizontal cracks.

Technical and funky mixed climbing up the tallest part of the wall. Par\u00a0for the cliff, the horizontal cracks take good protection but are awkward to climb with winter kit. Has been top-roped clean. Feels like M6/M7 in typical conditions.-Symptom of an Era (WI4): Good ice leads to a grungy finish.-The Lyre (WI4): Good ice route up a curtain with grungy rock finish. Needs prolonged cold.-Green Disease (WI4 M6): A great pillar (WI4) if it\u0092s touching down. Otherwise, climb overhung left-facing corner/roof to the right of the hanging dagger and pull onto the ice where the seam ends (M6). This is a sweet little trad mixed climb and it sews up well with a micro cam and finger-sized gear. At the top of the ice pillar, finish left up the corner/gully or up the arete.-Vine climb (M4): Just left of Green Disease. Climb a crack with a prominent vine in it to gain some thin ice and a short corner. Exit the upper corner on the left. Good protection and sometimes the lower part is all ice. The initial crack can also be used to start Green Disease.-Gangrene (M5): Just left. Pull a couple of strenuous moves over a blank section to reach a shallow corner/crack full of thick, green turf, then easier climbing to the top.-Hollowed Be Thy Name (WI4): The one to do. An obvious, long ice flow and the classic ice line at the crag. Can form as a narrow tube or wide curtain. Protect with good rock gear when thin.-Easy flows (WI2-WI4): Located left of \u0093Hollowed\u0094 is a wide curtain of very short but fat ice flows.-Dollar Bill Blues (WI4): First taller ice line left of the easy flows. A good pure ice line when in. Moderate ice leads to steep ice finish.-Mortal Distinction (WI4 M4): Very thin smear (poor\u00a0protection) leads to a mixed topout (better protection) through horizontal cracks.-Easy flow (WI2/3): Very short ice flow with grungy finish.-Nocturne (M4/5): Obvious left-angling crack. Good protection throughout with some turf/ice here and there in typical conditions.-Project: Climb the obvious thin crack with tenuous pick torquing past a bulge until you reach the easier ice finish.

People have been climbing here at the Main Wall since the early 1970's and new routes are still going up here today. The Main Wall at Chatfield has a good diversity routes in a beautiful hardwood forest setting. Chatfield's metamorphic gneiss rock is distinctively different from Central CT's trap rock. It has exquisitely featured grey and gritty overhanging walls, roofs, aretes, cracks, and slabs with a good mixture of grades for all climbers from a beginner climbing 5.3 to an expert climbing 5.13s. You'll be amazed by the holds you have to use on the routes here: finger cracks, jugs, huge slopers, underclings, edges, pockets, and razor blade crimps.What is unique here, unlike many other Connecticut climbing areas, is that all styles of climbing live in harmony here. You can climb traditional gear protected routes, mixed routes, or pure sport climbs. Chatfield is a great place to climb a lot of routes in a day. It is compact and there are a lot of good routes within a close space. Some great moderates include the Trad Crack, Clark Bar Crack, Kyles Corner, and Super Slab. If you are looking to test yourself check out the Anarchist, Zeitgeist, Shape Shifter, Cold Vein, Its Own Spirit or the massive link-up of the Modern Collective. All these routes are different and they all pack a unique style of punch from bouldery to technical. Last but definitely not least, the traditionally protected crack routes here are some of the best in the state. Routes like Forearm Frenzy and Wallow In the Hollow will test your knowledge of gear placement and your climbing talents. These routes are classics and should not be missed if you are able to climb them.If new to the area and you are coming here for the first time bring a rope, some quick draws, and a standard rack with lots of small and medium cams. Be very careful when you are walking on the delicate thin soils of the cliff top to set up your top ropes. Try as much as possible to tread lightly in this fragile environment. Walk on rock as much as possible. You'll see some dead trees and battered vegetation and muddy trails from years of top-roping use/abuse. Walk on established trails or bare rock when you are setting up your anchors. Also please pick up any trash you might see on the way in or at the cliff.

Its a scenic area with great views and accessibility right on the roadside, but its not legal to be there because the town doesn't want people jumping of the rocks. I projected this climb as a novice climber for a year, sending it this Summer after a friend revealed some productive beta. The route has an excellent ledge just above water level to gear up; it is an overhanging face climb with some moves that utilize the arete feature (but be careful because too far left or right of the distinguished line and the fall gets sketchy); the problem becomes increasingly difficult as you progress, starting at about 5.9 on the lower moves with crux moves that are easily 5.11a/b, possibly greater. Falls are safe on this line because of the direct line that overhangs right over the designated jumping water hole. The route also goes as an eliminate, without using the crucial arete crimp on the right face the sequence requires an athletic dyno to a side pull, letter grade harder maybe?
