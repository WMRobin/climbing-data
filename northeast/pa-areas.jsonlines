On top and back 10 ft is another massive buttress of stone rising another 15ft. That feature is where all the top rope anchors are and makes for an interesting setup. For climbs on the Front Walls, your rope goes down and out 10ft then over the edge of the lower section and down. It creates some drag and when the climber tops the lower part and proceeds to climb the upper part, the belayer loses visual.

There are 32 trad routes that were led ground up on gear and a few pins. Mel Hamel, Tom Moffatt and I , had our run of the place, and climbed the lines we could with the gear we had at the time.The original sequence numbers will be a little difficult to use as we always approached from the downstream end (climber's right), but the upstream end (climber's left) is used now.Only four climbs had fixed gear at the time, between 1981 and 1983, two each in the area behind the Great Wall, one pin on Fruition and one on Thunder Road. In some cases small cams which were not available at the time may allow ascents of climbs where the pitons disappeared, but use some care, particularly on the Rotwand, as we were in deck territory every time we went out the the nose to work on getting some gear.As I understand it, some routes have been bolted on the Great Wall. The most common center route on this wall has been led on gear at 5.8 X. We did some other routes that were pretty bold, and I am concerned these would get bolted unknowingly.

{"area_name": "Seldom Seen", "description": ["People have been climbing at the Seldom Seen Greenway for several decades, and, as a result of a major renovation in recent years, the area has seen a surge in popularity. As of the Spring of 2021, there are now 27 different routes that have been fully equipped (or re-equipped) with either stainless steel or titanium hardware. The routes are mostly 30-45\u2019 tall on the vertical walls of quarried sandstone blocks that make up a complex of bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. Although there is one route that is 5.6, and another that is 5.8, most of the routes are in the 5.9 - 5.10 range. \u00a0There are also four 5.11s and one 5.12. While no formal permission has been granted to climb at Seldom Seen, there have also been, to date, no serious access issues; nevertheless, anyone wishing to climb here should REVIEW THE ACCESS NOTES BELOW and use their own. A guide/topo for the area is in the works and will soon be available online and at the various local climbing gyms for $10, all proceeds to be donated to SWPACC to be used on future projects.Please be reminded of a few critical points in regard to the climbing at Seldom Seen. \u00a01. Acting independently, individual climbers, wishing to expand outdoor climbing opportunities for all residents and visitors to our region (including those who might not have access to climbing areas at more remote geographic locations) developed, equipped, and cleaned these areas. Neither the SWPACC nor the City of Pittsburgh cleaned/equipped these routes.\u00a02. Given the exciting potential for Seldom Seen and other urban climbing areas to expand and diversify our climbing community, the SWPACC has established an on-going dialogue with various city officials to develop a plan that would secure formal permission for climbing on various structures around the city. Historically, climbing at Seldom Seen has taken place discreetly, and as with so many other popular climbing areas, climbers should maintain a low profile.\u00a03. While the dialogue with the City is ongoing and no major access issues have arisen yet, AS OF YET NO FORMAL PERMISSION HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR CLIMBING ON ANY OF THE WALLS AT SELDOM SEEN. \u00a04. Only you and those in your party are responsible for your legality and safety when climbing at Seldom Seen. \u00a0YOU ARE CLIMBING AT YOUR OWN RISK when you choose to climb at Seldom Seen!!!5. PLEASE, stay off of the railroad tracks above the walls, to avoid interference with train operators. Any activity on or around those tracks will jeopardize access to this location.6. The earth behind the walls at Seldom Seen (as well as moisture after heavy rains) is constantly making its way through the cracks on these walls. Thanks to the revitalization of the past few years, and thanks to many hundreds (probably thousands!) of hours the routes are in their cleanest state ever. Nevertheless, their maintenance will require an on-going effort, especially in the spring when seepage and growth is at its highest. This area will only remain clean if climbers regularly carry a scraper and/or wire/nylon brush to remove any dirt and weeds from the cracks, and dirt from the climbing surfaces. The place will remain in the best possible condition if people spend just a little time cleaning upon lowering.7. As is a good routine habit to practice at all climbing areas, please consider taking a plastic bag with you when visiting this area and make an extra effort to pick up any trash that you notice in the vicinity. Because of the high traffic of non-climbers at the Greenway, Seldom Seen is likely to be a local area with significant impact on how the local climbing community is perceived by the general public.

There are also a couple high quality V0-1 problems, and a few excellent lines in the v5-6 range (Vlad and Founding Fathers), as well as a few other decent moderate lines in the v2-v4 range--enough to keep easy- to moderate- climbers interested for a day or so, but probably not much beyond that. There are about 8 short, stout sport routes, also, generally of average quality, with the exception of one stunning bolted line that would be v14-ish if you didn't need a rope (but you do).\u00a0Because the terrain at the rocks is quite rough and the boulders are concentrated, there isn't a lot of room to move around, and the main zone probably can't handle more than 10 or so people at a time.
