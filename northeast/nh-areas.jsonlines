{"area_name": "Table Mountain", "description": ["\u00a0Bear Notch Road is OPEN as of May, 2021.At the end of May we were up there and noted the cord(s) of several of the top tree anchors were cut through, either by animals with teeth or human with knife. (Some cuts were very straight, others fuzzy like chewed) This included: the \u201cback up rope\u201d for the top Bugs Eat Frogs rap, the cord at the top of Red Knight\u2019s Romp ( the new, bright green cord placed by someone other than the FA-ers, which implies the cord and quick link placed by the FA-ers had been removed or cut..?! ) and one of the cords at the maple tree island at the top of P1 of Holy Grail. CHECK YOUR ANCHOR CORD before trusting it.Pleasant climbing on a 200 - 300 ft south facing slab about 45-50 min. hike; nice rock, most (if not all) old 1/4\" bolts have been replaced, and hardly anyone ever goes there, even on crowded weekends. Most climbs are reasonably well protected at their cruxes and \"run out\" portions are usually 2 to 4 grades below the climb's crux rating.The best approach to the base is to hike up the well-maintained hiking trail and rap in. \u00a0Anchors (dbl 3/8 or 5/16th inch bolts) are \"set\" on four lines. (3 on Main Slab). Your last rap sets up a top-rope on some of the best climbing. (Regardless of which of the rap options you decide to use!) this site lists several new routes that do not appear in the latest, Handren, guidebook. ENJOY!Once at the base, you will find the immediate 3-4 ft from the cliff to the trees quite easy walking, especially from Picnic Table to near Merlin. From Merlin west to the start of \"False Holy Smoke\" there is a bit of a slab-scramble down, usually using pine branches for an \"assist\", although there are other ways to make this move. From \"False Holy Smoke\" to the end of the slab the walking is again easy.Should you get caught in a sudden downpour, probably the EASIEST, MOST PROTECTED WAY UP (and out) is to climb P1 (5.4-5.5) of False Holy Smoke, and then P2 of Old Smokey's Return. This gets you to the upper Merlin Rap station, where a climber's path leads up and right, returning you back to the \"Bugs\" rap station and the hiking trail.In a true emergency it is possible to hike out in the tree-and-bush filled gully about 150 +/- ft right of \"Bugs Eat Frogs\". Look for a cairn at the base, and take care with some lose rock, but there is nothing technical in the ascent. The top section is described in the approach to Arthur\u2019s arete and Caldor Crack.HISTORY- Probably the first climb on the slab was put in by Paul Ross and Julia Blake in the summer of 1976. They bushwhacked directly in from the Kanc with difficulty locating the slab. (Uhg !!!). Paul named the* route they did that day \"Dragon Fly\" for the insect, of which there were many flitting around, while he (essentially) soloed on lead (no bolts for THAT Brit!). He \"graded it 5.7\" (That's \"old school\" 5.7 !) on \"the best looking bit of the slab...to the top of the slab...and might have been [in the area of] Knights (in White Satin) or Holy Grail\".** The fact that Paul did six (6) new climbs on Rainbow on one day, while only doing this one on Table, kind of gives you a clue as to the bushwhacking and logistics they encountered coming in from the Kanc!(Italic quotes from a personal e-mail communication (July 2015) from Paul after he had consulted his \"FA notes\".)The current Handren \"North Conway\" Guidebook covers this this cliff, but since the guide was published (2012) the \"Holy Smoke\" mystery has been solved, and six new routes, plus a new P2, have been added:\u00a0 1)The Old Smokey's Return, 2)Merlin's Wand, 3)Percival's Quest, Sir Bors Dream now has a P2 it probably didn't have before, and 4)Sir Hector's Highway, 5) Cader Crack, and 6) King Arthur's Arete.The climb that Handren, and Ed Webster before him, named \"Holy Smoke\" has been re-named here \"False Holy Smoke\". [See more on this in the COMMENTs, if you're interested.] The real \"Holy Smoke\" (FA by the \"two Dougs\") included what would later be climbed as P1 of Table Scraps and the last pitch of Picnic Table."], "location": ["Although visible easily from the \"Kanc\" Highway (esp. traveling Eastbound east of Bear Notch Rd), unequivocally the best approach is to hike in via the Attitash trail off the east side of Bear Notch Road (BNR), about a 45-60min. hike. From North Conway, drive north on Rt16 to Glen, then straight ahead on Rt 302 to Bartlett. (Or take West Side Road from No. Conway to 302) In Bartlett, turn left (south) up the Bear Notch Road, drive about 2 1/4 miles to a pull out on the left, just before a sharp turn. More recently the hike up Table has been \"discovered\" by hikers and there is now a possibility you may find the small lot \u00a0full. \u00a0One can park on level ground on the opposite side of the road just downhill of the trailhead parking, or at a paved pull out about 1/4 mile towards Bartlet.With a rope, gear and some water-and-lunch\u00a0I find the hike up about 50 minutes from Bear Notch.\u00a0 That's for me, younger climbers have reported as fast as 20-25 min! ( about 2 miles and 1300 vertical feet) A very pleasant hike, with a lovely stream & pool, hardwood forest and nice views on the final 1/3 of the hike. The trail goes over a few slabs with open views to the West and South, but you know you have come to the correct slab when the view opens up to the East and can see Albany Covered Bridge [see photo]; I usually \"gear up here\" [it's nice and flat and sunny] and then go back down the hiking trail about 25 ft to the climber's path (cairn, now on your left). Down this steeply 50 yds or so to the \"Bugs Eat Frogs\" rap tree (15\" diameter pine with fixed rap station), or from this rap tree walk about 75 yds West and down to a bolt-and-thread fixed anchor that drops down to Merlin's belay/rap station. (more on this below)The new \"North Conway\" guide, which basically copies Webster for this cliff, is pretty good but suffers from one serious flaw and that is the LOCATION of the intermediate rap anchor on Bugs Eat Frogs on the PHOTO in the book. While stating (as does Webster) in the text that this station is 140 feet below the \"rap\" tree [It's actually about 160ft] the photo places the anchor WAY TOO HIGH, at a place where one could not even see the correct anchor.Rap Descents: [corrected/edited June 2016] See the photo \"Rap Lines and Paths\", below.#1 The \"upper Merlin\" rap, single 60m rope, 2 raps: NOTE: While a 70m is recommended, it is possible to make these raps with a 60m rope. [Originally this rap was listed as requiring a 70m rope. It turns out my \"70m rope\" had shrunk 8-9 meters and I didn't know it. That being said, let's hope your 60m hasn't shrunk. ]The top station for this rap line can be reached by a 'path' that starts a few feet above the \"Bugs\" Rap-tree. This path leads West 75-100ft, down 40 ft, then over another 50 ft and down 50 ft to the station, a slung flake and a 3/8\" SS bolt.Make a single-rope (100 ft/30m) rap to the Merlin belay/rap station [toss the ropes straight down and to viewer's left of the shrubby tree on the ledge 30 ft below.] Then another 30 meter (100 ft) rap to the ground (swinging to rappeller's right).The Merlin belay now consists of two 3/8\" SS bolts and chains, plus one of the original 1/4\" bolts. THE FLAKE ABOVE AND TO THE LEFT IS HOLLOW.Another belay about 30 ft West (rapeller's left) of the Merlin belay is a dbl bolt 3/8\" ss on the route \"False Holy Smoke\", but the rap to the ground is more than 30-35m.#2 \"Bugs Eat Frogs\" Two Rope Rap, 2 raps: From the tree at the end of the climber's approach path, rap with 2 ropes 150 ft to the \"Bugs\" bolted belay. Then rap 80 ft to the ground.#3 \"Dick to the Rescue/Table Talk\" single 60m rope rap, 3 raps\": Starting from the same top \"Bugs\" rap-tree, it is also possible to rap about 60ft to a small pine tree on rapeller's right (viewer's left) to a 3/8\" bolt backed up by the tree.

{"area_name": "Holts Ledge", "description": ["Here is a big surprise, I am introducing this area in 2012 to MP. The ledge has had ice climbers here since the 1980's or earlier. Its mostly excellent water ice and retreat is always easy after climbing. Its wide open at the cliff line so walking is easy from climb to climb.    The ledge has some unusual direction to it because the climbs are on the northeast side or right side facing the ledge. The central and left side of the ledge is a much higher cliff. The winter sun directs its sunlight here most of the day. Nice place to go to get a lot of climbs in during a short winter's day. That is because the climbs are lined up like dominoes. All of the routes can be rappelled by trees. There is a walk off north or right back down to where you came to the bottom.    The first iced slab you'll see on the approach is a long iced over steep start to it slab. Its always fat WI3-4 ice at its bottom half. The top half gets aerated or too dry sometimes. Several years the WI4 curtain at the slab base became detached. Don't know it until your on top of it. Anyway there is little to no risk with the curtain and most routes here.    Snow melt is a big factor to consider about this area. It is semi dependent on it for the routes furthest left. From the middle ice flow of Jaws (below the large ceiling) and the gullies right are ground fed and not affected so much by drought winters. All of these climbs come in every year eventually. The heights of routes are approximate and might be much longer than I remember.   The routes I know are from the one's I climbed. I climbed the place out over several years except for one possible route on the higher ledge. I got to where I no rope soloed the routes. I invited Ted Hammond to no rope solo with me. We knocked most of them off on a single day together in winter 86-87.     Its like an outdoors ice climbing gym in snowy winters.    The DOC has top roped here for years and probably led the routes. This place has remained, too this day not listed in any guide books. I saw the ice potential trying to do a rock route here in 1982. Winter 83-84 I did Spiral Staircase as my first roped in lead. I quit going here in 1987. The access became private land developed, where I used too park.

The dome center and heading south consist of hand steep jam cracks that pass through horizontal cracks to begin with. The north side of the dome is more vegetated and slabbed as I recall it. Room for a few more routes here are a certainty and it takes all day to rock climb directly here from the slabs. Depending on where the car is parked it could be a very long walk too the car. So skip all of that and just go to the dome by trail. A light rack of draws is all that should be brought and it is important that the gear rack be mostly 2-4 cams and some doubles in that size could be necessary and for rappels down to the dome's base? The base is open and ledge and safe as good as being on the ground because below this brush. Climbing is at 3700-3999 appropriately. The last hundred feet is low almost walking angle. There is an excellent source for water before the summit approach to Webster Mt. I won't say drink it untreated (I used too).

(Walking south keep an eye out for the cairn on the right; if you miss it you'll come to the 8\" drain-ditch through the tracks about 30-40 RR ties south (beyond) the cairn and path.)NOTE on SORTING ROUTES- The normal \"path\" from the RR tracks ends at the far right of the buttress at the climb \"First Shot\", so in walking along the base the climbs are encountered in a furthest-RIGHT-to-LEFT order.A somewhat steep, but short approach from the RR tracks rewards the climber with an interesting cliff. Quite different from the slab routes on the main slab of Willard. Routes are moderate and some fairly well protected. If desired, the \"R\" and \"X\" routes (or at least their most interesting portions) can be TR'd (after leading one of the 5.6 - 5.7 routes) with a little ingenuity, 2 ropes and long slings.With \"Gunkswest\"'s contributions, I think that most of the known routes are now listed herein.

{"area_name": "Main Wall, The", "description": ["The Main Wall of Greens is an impressive band of rock running a little over 1/3 of a mile wide and mostly about 250 feet tall. It offers a bounty of climbing of various styles, with some superb cracks, face climbing, steep slab and flake systems.The approach from Sawyer Pond Trail brings you under the right side of the cliff. A short spur leads to a sort of a featured buttress, a little over 100 feet tall, with a nice cluster of one and two pitch 9s and 10s, which makes it a good place to start the day.Moving to the left, as the cliff gets taller, huge blocks have been plucked out from the base of the cliff to create a large ledge with big roofs above. If you hug the cliff you can scramble up via a little notch (about 40' to the left of Global Warming) to the right side of the ledge, where you will find an old fire ring and some good spots to bivy. Otherwise, the main trail stays out from the cliff a bit until it brings you to the left side of the overhangs, near El Dorado. There is currently only one route that goes through the roofs, Fireside Crack, that starts just right of the fire ring.A few words about camping here: It is less necessary since the new way in makes day trips easy, but it is a great bivy spot with the fire ring, protection of the big roofs above, relatively flat spots to lay your pads and a great view. If you use it please leave it as you found it or better. Keep the place nice, and be very careful if you have a fire to keep it under control so no embers fly out and land below. Remember to hang you food well. Also, don't just piss off the ledge. It is protected from rain and would get nasty smelling in no time. Go out further. Please don't leave trash in the fire ring. There is an iron grate stashed behind the leaning slab by the fire. If you use it to cook, when done please return it to its place, out of sight. Etiquette suggests replacing any wood you found and used in a neat small stack (dead beach wood is best) so if the next person is stuck in the rain they will have something to get warm with. Needless to say, bury your shit and TP well and away from the cliff. When you leave, aside from the fire ring and a small neat stack of wood, it should not look like people have camped there, and stir the ashes around and make damn sure the coals are 100% out. This shouldn't have to be said, but I have found the place abused and it is very discouraging.Continuing the cliff tour: The roofs continue on for a couple hundred feet, then you drop down off the scree ledge and come to where the cliff is a very steep, sheer slab. I think this is the portion I believe Mike Hartrich referred to as the Porcelain Wall. Above, in steeper second pitch territory are many attractive features, but, so far, the slab has only been cracked by Moldy Bolts, a 12a ground up bolted line that follows a thin seam to a ledge.The next feature you get to is the obvious line of Stewart's Crack, the first pitch of which follows a great handcrack up a left facing corner to a belay ledge. Moving further left, past a couple jumbley, partial height corners, you will come to the wafer thin Ginsu Flake and the classic 2 pitch vertical crack of Greenpeace. The cliff here is about 250 feet tall and steep, with a further 100 foot+ crown of slab above.Fifty feet past Greenpeace the huge arch of Arch Duke Dude begins, a large, left leaning, \u00a0overlap arch . If you are looking for Black Flies Consume Jim Dunn, you will find it running up the steep slab to the upper end of the arch. Above is a steep two pitch system of dramatic flakes and corners, with another system, The Muffin Man, 50 feet to the left. The theme of steep slab up to another pitch or two of steeper feature climbing continues leftwards with the classic flake of Green Party.\u00a0At this point the base of the cliff begins to rise and the cliff gradually shortens. From Green Party and Trust the Rubber, you get up to the left end by scrambling up the slabby corner up left to another level (careful). The first routes you pass are the 2 pitch sport route Snaking the Drain 12a+ then the mixed I'm Still Here, which both start up a couple bolts of easy slab into a vertical headwall Just to the left, is an orange (probably green now) right facing corner capped by a roof.

About 30-35 ft below the start of \"Summer Breeze\" or \"Road to Lhasa\" a path leads climber's-left (south) through the trees to a steepish, dirt-covered ledge system with a slabby drop-off below. [Photo] This ledge provides access to the climb \"What's Up Yankee\", BUT beyond that climb the ledge peters-out at a mossy slab. Taking care, make a 4-5 ft move down.[2021 Update - the safety fixed rope placed\u00a0in this area in 2017 was removed by person(s) unknown, probably by the same person who has been cutting the cord(s) on top tree anchors at Table Mtn, Rainbow and other crags. See COMMENT on sketch-photo.] Walk climber's-left and up 25-35 ft to another ledge. The end of this ledge is the start of Lucky Charms. Birthday Brushings starts to the right.If you are headed to \"Pillars of Dickulese\" stay lower and move to climber's left. Look for the bolt on P1. (photo with that climb's description)Headed for \"Watermellon\" or \"Whit's End\" continue further left, then scramble up to the far left end of the large tree-and-dirt ledge. (photo below)2) Probably the 2nd easiest way - A second way is to climb one of the standard climbs in the Mid-Section (or Height-of-Land) all the way to the trees, (e.g. Face Dances, Coloring Book, Dead Easy etc.) then walk climber's left along the top of the cliff. About 30-40 ft \"inland\" from the edge is the easiest walking; there's a faint path. You will come to the LARGE pine tree with rap slings (red 7mm, 2014) which is the top of \"Pillars\". Rap down with two ropes to the 5/16th-inch double bolt belay/rap station of \"pillars\", then double ropes to the ground.A 2nd rap line is located 40-50 ft to climber's right (left, looking out) of the large pine. This is the top rap station for \"Birthday Brushings\" and is a smaller pine with a fixed anchor. Two raps with a single 70 meter rope reaches the base, and the mid-cliff station (2 bolts) is on a real ledge (as opposed to the station on \"Pillars\".) Be sure your rope is a full 70 meters for the 2nd rap, use doubled ropes, or extend the anchor with a sling! It is not known whether two, doubled 60m ropes would reach the base from the top anchor in a single rap.3) Direct Approach from Fire Road - From all the way back at the Forest Logging Road (constructed in 2014), follow it beyond the normal turn-off to its end (past a smaller \"pull off area\" on the right) to where there's a HUGE, cleared \"staging area\". Starting at where the road first widens to become this cleared area, bushwhack through the woods at a compass setting of 0 / 360-degrees magnetic, i.e. exactly magnetic north. It's flat for a while and then climbs steeply to reach the far, far left end of the Rainbow. (10-15 min, a cairn and/or flagging may be encountered). Once you see the LOW-ANGLE, mossy slab on your left, move towards it and up along it going through \"2 ft passage\" between a VERY large pine on your right and the mossy slab on the left. [See photos of what you should see upon approaching the slab.]The hiking now levels off. Walk along the base (reasonably clear as of 2013-14) passing by \"Inspectrum\" after about 250 feet. 50 ft further you'll come to the large corner and the start of the wide, dirt, tree-ledge. Stay straight ahead to get on the tree ledge and the starts of \"Sol\", \"Watermelon\" and \"Wit's End\", or descend diagonally to the right to the \"base area\" and the starts of \"Pillars\" and \"Lucky Charms\", etc.4) Using the approach \u00a0given in the \"Getting There\" section for Rainbow), stay on the path until just after crossing the small stream at the base of the final, steep section of \"trail\". Do not climb the steep slope on the normal approach path, but rather move left (south).\u00a0 In about 150 ft cross over the small watercourse coming from your left (sort of out of a cave) and continue another 150 ft, then start climbing on a rising diagonal upwards and to the left. If \"on route\" you should hit a patch of ferns, here climb more or less straight uphill (steeply) 5-10 minutes to the area at the base area around \"Pillars\"."], "path": "WM: Kancamagus (Eastern)|Rainbow Slabs|1.

{"area_name": "Zealand Notch Itself: Whitewall Mountain", "description": ["Zealand Notch used to be called New Zealand Notch because of it's similarity to the great forest of New Zealand.    From 1884 to 1905 a logging baron named J.E. Henry put an end to the existence of this forest. There is a cliff on Whitewall Mountain facing west in this notch. I saw a blasted drill hole on a stone beneath the highest rock wall in the south central section. It appears the cliff on the central to southern half was blasted out by dynamite to be made into terraced slopes to catch and stop rock slides. Rockslides could have derailed his trains and track below. The trail to Whitewall Mt. is the timber baron's railroad bed and the highest point of it is 2,500+ft.     There were a couple of great fires that burned 20,000 acres about 105 years ago after J.E. Henry had moved onto the east branch of the Pemigewasset River region to cut timber.    The fires were so hot that when it was safe to inspect the devastation to the notch's environment, forest scientist reported there was nothing left accept whitened rocks. Rocks that were exposed because all of the forest loam had burned away above them. Soon afterward there were 13 rocks slides reported. These open exposed rocks from the fires are still evident today especially on the south western spur and the lowest ground level of the notch. Thick white birch trees that had died on the stump, many have regrown hardy branches at they're bases, They thrive with their dead tree trunks still standing at the cliffside. Eerie, they went on living after those devastating consequences of fires from J.E . Henry oblivion.  His and others like him, had cut and left the slashed off tree tops in the forest, after the fires happened folks of the N.H. and Boston region got together to petition and pass through N.H. legislator 'the Weeks Act', to protect the forest permanently from these dangerously to combustion logging procedures. Whitewall is not unique to the White Mountains having open rock slab faces from fires.     Whitewall Mt. mostly a terraced cliff is about 500ft. high. Topographically it top's out about 400 ft. below it's 3400ft. summit. The northern side central slab and walls have low angle ice with short vertical head walls. Climbs are probably three pitches long with options right or left to finish it. Either way there could be a mixed climbing finish to them. I speculate all the climbs are  WI3-4. There is ice at the large chimney cave left facing corner on the southern central side. Ice flows are on the lower slab walls furthest south on this mountain is good access to the large chimney. All of these ice routes have not been done.    The rock slide between the northern rock buttresses supposedly frequently avalanches. Avalanches look likely to happen from above the tops of the ice flows also because in the summer it is mostly open steep slopes of Labrador Rhododendron, small trees and talus sand fields. These trees and talus won't secure the snow that piles up because this mountain is the first big obstacle a storm must pass over before getting to the Presidential Range. Therefore the snow and ice climbs may be similar to Huntington's Ravine on Mt. Washington. Where the trees are thickest on these slopes, is a good indicator of the least avalanche zoned areas.   Rock climbing potential is high on Whitewall and dangerous until tested and all the time the validity of the rock must be analyzed about it's safety. The granite composite rock is definitely weathered and old on the north side, exposed to the worst environment that exist at about 3000ft. The north and northern central cliff appear undisturbed by J.E. Henry's timber annihilation ambition.    Conway granite is on the northern side and then becomes included with white fine granite at the cliff's base and the entire northern central side. Then the rock becomes conway granite again at the cliff high head wall wall until the further south passed the chimney giant left facing corner fine Granite returns, only to go back to Conway granite at the superb crack section, finally reached south again fine granite above a open book left facing corner with likely sharp rock edges for face climbing after this corner or there is a finish directly up left . This is a two pitch section. It is difficult to know where blasted rock stops and preexisting undisturbed rock starts. I have an educated guess now the blasting happened where there is a tree fill giant pocket in the cliff.    There are plenty of unstable rocks everywhere on the cliff side.  Small boulders are distributed about on the tree slopes, some directly beneath a likely blasted rock wall. Bloody hikers have reported talus moving onto the Ethan Pond trail (railroad bed) below the cliff during the summer months. These rocks are mainly from the north side and nearest to the longest ice flow sections. Freeze, thaw exfoliation happens almost the entire year because the cliff can be freezing cold on summer nights. This popular hiking trail is below a actively exfoliating mountain and is part of the Appalachian Trail.    Most of it's rock climbing is very similar to being on Cannon cliff. It's longest talus field rock slide is on the north side and is very loose. The south side rock slide is firmer because the rocks are much bigger. Both are good for descent. Rappelling the cliff is dangerous because of the many loose stones at top but the northern central section is clear enough for rappelling before the summit. Unless your planning on going to the western spur, I highly recommend rappelling. I have not set up a rappel location. All of the climbs will top out either into the gnarly pine forest on the southern side or the wide open sandy spaces of the northern central and north side. This is definitely a sensitive to weather and erosion area mountain that has had recent cliff rock slides. Ecologically this mountain's is still recovering from the fires and is near enough to be a member of the Presidential Range hostile environments. It has above tree sensitive alpine plant areas. The W.M.N.F. hasn't curtailed any where from hikng ascents yet. I contacted them about rock climbing and it's okay.   Most of the entire cliff is unexplored. Climbs are all over the mountain to be done, all year round on white fine and pink granite conglomerates     The trees are thick beneath the highest southern buttresses most carefulness walk off. Confounded loose blocks or short tree climbing down ledges encountered. Confrontations to deal with along any journey upward and down here. Whitewall is the last incredible climbing area of approximately 1/2-1/4 mile wide.   Below the southern face is terraced by fifty to eighty feet of steep blacked walls, that can be gotten to from the southern talus field. This can be an awful approach but inwards or up some on the southern talus field is a boulder path far left that is narrow and goes direct to these black walls. Also cliff side north can be walked from here. Pro is little to none visible from the cliff side. Clean rock and there is a line up that looks moderate. Right of these blackened slabs is a horrible area of steep open dirt slope traverses on uncertainty footing, perpetual short wet walls and some fifty+ ft. drop offs below these slopes. Not cool.       The giant overhang (King Henry?) with it's several possibilities to climbing on or around it, sticks out like a lighthouse and overlooks this entire area . The rock is excellent with a Yosemite likeness too it sometimes. In my opinion the best way to this white granite upper wall is by rock climbing up diagonally until directly below it by the Red Queen route approach.    All of the rock is extremely good rock to climb on generally. It will always be dangerous for so many reasons, the simplest dangers there are the usual loose stones a bushwhacker climber encounters on any first descent. A greater riskiness is having to deal with boulders, blocks, and stones in the talus fields on all levels of the mountain's climbing slopes. What's real and what's been altered by dynamite and fires is also here to ponder. The Yosemite like granite is likely blasted rock because it doesn't have old rock appearance and feel. on This mountain rock where it looks really old, it is and has very slippery black lichen on it. It has almost all year freeze, thaw conditions. The talus fields on the climbs are becoming safer after more ascents moving loose rocks. Bad weather can be seen coming towards the mountain from a distance but the mountain's unique environment is also capable of creating it's own weather suddenly.     Lastly a variety of routes possibly at 100+ft of rock bulging steeply most north and Best access I can think of involves getting onto the Black knight and rappel into this section. Big draw back here is above it is old loose rock that is orange/brown rotten and has had recent rock slides. The southern side of this alcove area is a gully devoid of any direct sunlight that likely has a one pitch ice route on it's northeastern inside. Sounds cold.   Whitewall Mountain, I'd respect it, it is very close to the wilderness designated area. I travel as light as possible to it because there is about a ten mile walking experience besides 500ft or more of route finding while climbing. TCU's work well here. Depending on what you intend to climb determines the rack. The crack section is all hand cracks to finger cracks. A double rack of two and three range cams would be helpful only in this section.        I have been unable to find out any mountaineering history on this mountain. I don't know why. No vintage pitons found yet. In the 1930's it must have still been a waste land. There is a faint trail to a cache box on the true summit to place your name in it. W.M.N.F. is collecting data on how many people are ascending the mountain. If you're interested, add yourselves to this cache summit box listing.     Keep it cool with loose rocks, hikers are often below and try to leave no trace. If you do climb on Whitewall, it'll be difficult to go unnoticed with the A.M.C. Hut nearby and hikers below. They often stop to watch us climb. It's a little nerve racking, most hikers don't realize they are in danger from any rock fall from climbers above them, so trundling here is a bad idea.      N.H. has a pay for rescue service so don't get lost, and don't get hurt so much you'll require a rescue. There is no cell phone service here and it'll be expensive. The forest is very thick and rocky, so becoming lost and getting injured could become lost and dead.    South of Mt. Whitewall off of the Ethan Pond Trail is a west facing rock slab with a head wall spur on Mt. Willey.  It also is granite 300+ft of elevation. It doesn't have that busted up fractured appearance to it, that Mt. Whitewall has. There is a leanto shelter near the pond. This spur also has no rock climbing history that I can find.    There have been 7 ice flows (some not long) done on the spur above the Ethan Pond area. These winter ascents are posted at neice.com and a couple were listed as two pitch+ climbs. There is a decent photo of the iced slab and it's steep top off section but I had some difficulty finding it. I don't do well at navigating this site.

The \"Main Face\" has seen spurts of development in the 1980's, 1990's and the 21st Century. By-and-large the rock is clean, solid and fairly well protected with some climbs having been recently \"retro-bolted in 'trad' style\" (i.e. \"X-factors\" removed but not eliminating the risk-reward challenge.) Climbers should be aware of 'hollow' flakes that, while usually OK to use for climbing, it might be best to not place cams behind them, lest the cams pry out in a fall, or worse break off the flake. This is not a usual problem, but be aware!Approach is about 30-40 minutes by a good hiking trail. Views are SPECTACULAR!

[See the \"climb\" listed as \"Center Cliff Rap Line\" for directions]The \"Suzy Q\" rap line [See the \"climb\" Suzy Q Rap Line for directions] can be rapped using either two 60M ropes in one long rap, or can be rapped with two raps using a single 70m (but not single 60m).

The central ice comes in a similar way, having one main vein of ice separated into three directions of ice left, center and right (facing the cliff).

The right branch is called 'Boulder Problems' and was the first route we did. It starts right of 'Drip of Fools' the rock climb. Drip of Fools is a nice big frozen drip and the bolts could get you part way up it or more but it will likely scar the rock. That shouldn't be done.        The western side has short ice routes with connection to the upper tier. When these tiers are in firm winter condition, doing it is called Pizzazz.        G Spot is all boulder problem height ice routes or short flows (20-40 feet)and a couple of routes are from connecting the tiers into being one multiple pitch ascent.

Stanton parking lot. head west through woods a short distance.Updated Descriptions, R Hall, 2017 &2021:\u00a01) Stanton Trail approach (per comment by A Winters] Allow ~20-30 minutes for the approach. Park at Mt. Stanton trailhead, walk ~150 yards from the trailhead, past the right-hand curve then take a left off the main trail onto the easy to miss orange-blazed trail. Follow the trail for about a half mile until you are \"under\" the cliff, then start your bushwhack uphill. The forest is wide and open and easy to navigate. When you reach the talus under the cliff, follow the cairns to the base. Best approach if you plan to hike off.Jay Morse (2017) adds: \" in the summer when the leaves are thick you will not be able to see the cliff. After about a half-mile on the faintly orange-blazed trail you will be taking the first, fairly obvious obvious herd path on the right side. Follow the cairns up the talus field and you will end up very close to Endeavor. \"2) Rick's Road Approach\u00a0(NOTE- Rick's road is now in MUCH better shape than it was a few yrs ago) Per comment by 'BALDY', with R Hall updates: 4/10 of a mile past the Y intersection you will see \"Ricks Road, on the left\", a dirt road that follows the bank of the Saco. Follow this road 0.55 miles until you see an old logging road w/ a small pullout on the right. [see photo, this is the 2nd logging road you'll come to] You are directly below the cliff.

Some new cairns have been added, but the path is less obvious in these places. Two places of note are: 1) when you come to the branches of a large fallen tree(s) generally keep right, and 2) where a huge tree trunk has fallen it is circumvented by going down to its base and then immediately back up left. \u00a015-20 mins for the hike in this way.
