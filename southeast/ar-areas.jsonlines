From the north-west point of the ridge, you can look across the valley, back toward the Throne, easily looking over all of the trees, especially during the winter months.

Eventually, bushwhacking dropped me to the creek and an impassable slot where the creek cut down and through a layer of polished, light colored rock. The water was flowing, so traversing right, along  the top of the rock, an eventual rappel allowed for a good look. First over the edge then down and out on the face, my heart pounded as the excitement  of a  potentially new wall overwhelmed the senses. Wow, limestone! Solid, overhanging, right here at Sam's Throne, just needing a little TLC. So, over future visits, several lines were scouted, worked, climbed, or planned for future bolting.

The first bolted route, put up in 2007, as a mixed route, follows a few pockets and bolts up the overhang to a vertical face then ends, at the top, by climbing through a drainage.
