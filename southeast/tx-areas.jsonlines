{"area_name": "Adair Springs", "description": ["This small bouldering area has a few good routes on moderate to excellent limestone on public land (Army Corps of Engineers or ACE) . It is bordered by the Nolan River and about 3 miles from the town of Blum. It is near the confluence of the Nolan River and Rock Creek.", " The land across the river is also park land and is used for hunting. Avoid this area during hunting season for the obvious reasons. Those dates can be found here: ( tpwd.texas.gov/regulations/\u2026 ). Otherwise there are a couple of bouldering areas on the other side. The hike is about 2 miles and is rough. There is a network of faint trails and an old rail line passing through the opposite side and a few historic structures located there. For example there are the remains of an old railroad bridge made of massive limestone blocks. These are upstream along the Nolan. I've ridden my bike here many times and other than cactus I've never had a problem.", " This area is very popular with fishing community. It is well known to the DFW fly fishing community and to the local worm and minnow variety of fishing.", " The main climbing area is located on the Eastern side of the river and Rock creek and is not usually legal to hunt. ", " There is a long low bluff across the river with some interesting options for bouldering. There are some tallish cliffs but seemed too chossy to toprope. I've always approached this area from the north along a biking trail that passes the bluff. There is an old railroad bridge-stop here and turn around. A few yards before the bridge it's possible to see railroad ties in the ground. Follow these back up and left to a trail that goes up this small canyon. As you approach the top of the hill a low line of good limestone extends to the right. The first good spot is the \"Baked wall\" and is notable for a long heel traverse. The second good spot is all the way around the bluff passing under some dubious cliffs. Along the northern side is the \"Bee Hive wall\". From here one can see the highway. Don't get hurt out here. It's a long way home.", " Summary: A pretty and small climbing area on public land. There are some shared access issues with hunters but this is easily avoided with common sense.", " There are hiking and biking trails and sometimes the water is good for swimming.", " Also this place is full of wildlife from deer to eagles and has big fields of bluebonnets and other wild flowers.", " Occasionally Lake Whitney will rise and flood this entire region-when this happens,go to the gym."], "location": ["The parking area is located just outside the town of Blum.

There is a line of chossy bluffs that marks the trail. The trail walks along a ledge midway up the cliff band. This is a popular trail and often has abandoned fishing trash.

{"area_name": "Private Bouldering Spot (Name pending)", "description": ["1/1/16 - Happy new year. Water has naturally washed away dirt under two large boulders that sits under the first bouldering spot listed below. This opens up a cave big enough to do some very fun starts! Piecing one together now that may require a pretty fun dyno or bat hang right out of the start. But worried pulling on this move for too long could loosen the Boulder. Set one v0 route called \"Red Red Whine, Stay Close To Me\" - my wife flashed and got the first ascent (will post it later) but the top out is a mantal on a loose Boulder... The top has washed off to the point of having safe top outs, thinking of purchasing some rope to tie off on a tree above for further support and lower the total impact made on the nature... and lastly bringing top rope today to determine the capability of top outs and routes.  ", "  Background:   I've searched most of the Greenbelt for any potential bouldering spots for the past few years. I've finally found two spots, both some what close to each other (definitely walking distance), and both are extremely accessible from the established entrances on the green belt.  ", "  First bouldering spot:    This spot will require some brooms, removal of dead limbs, and help with loose rocks. Probably 30-40 problems ready to be set. I've never seen anyone around or near these spots, and I've also never seen any indication of chalk or attempts to clean/climb the area. From V0 to potentially V6, maybe higher once the top outs are cleaned up or if there is a traversing route.. I haven't tried to climb anything yet because there are a lot of loose rocks and holds that will obviously come off. I've put about a weeks worth of cleaning around it. Pulling dead limbs from the top out and putting force on the obvious loose rocks... Currently it's too dangerous to climb, the top out needs a lot of care. A broom would be a huge benefit. I will be buying one and hiding it in the location for further use. There are two, almost cave like sections with what appear to be some really awesome potential. Positive walls, but mostly negative walls. The possibilities are endless. As I was making my way through the dead limbs and loose rocks on the top out, I also found there are two or three 5-6ft boulders that could make for some fun little routes. The tallest boulder I'd say is nearly a highball.. around 10-15ft. Everything has really awesome top out potential, and I'd think everything will be a sit start.  ", "  Second bouldering spot:   I'm really surprised this has been overlooked, again this is just another spot with a bunch of dead trees/limbs covering it. This will take a lot less time to climb and has a lot of really cool variations. With positive, neutral, cave start, negative pieces, and  This is very close to a very hard sport climbing crag but it's off the beaten path and also has two cave like sections for challenging starts. ALSO again has amazing top outs, (once the dead tree limbs are removed) and at the top out there is this really really cool - 2 to 3ft off the ground cave piece, you could easily be entirely under neath this for a start, it's such a large piece of stone that I'd be curious to see how setting a route under neath would work out, and it has a very tricky section pulling from under this little roof/cave. Not very long problem but potential for good training or very HIGH V-rating. This entire bouldering spot is a bit more on the beaten path on the green belt, but it's isolated enough that no one has thought to try it out! I'm most excited about this because there is very little to clean and for a small two/three boulders... it has a TON of variations. I would say there is potential for 15 classic bouldering problems.

We were not hassled or approached, but that's not to say that future climbers will have the same experience.While most folks head to Garner to have a picnic and float the Frio, the area has some decent potential for climbing. The face of Baldy is the most obvious option, but there are a few other cliffs throughout the park that may also have opportunities to climb. We only committed half a day to actually trying to climb as it was over 100 degrees, but hopefully others will get out there and see if there's anything else worth climbing. Definitely bring a helmet, as there is a lot of loose rock, and there is a real risk of people throwing/kicking rocks off the top of Baldy. Overall, the rock has good sections of solid limestone with sections of loose, crumbly limestone sprinkled throughout, and the walls are dead vertical to slightly overhung. Expect to work around cacti, lichens, and loose rock. You'll be in the shade most of the day which helps keep things cool. If you decide to climb here, many hikers will likely approach you and ask what you're doing. PLEASE assure them that you are being safe and taking the necessary precautions to do so.
