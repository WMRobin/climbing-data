Thirty to 40' before entering the Cookbook, just before the trail goes uphill, look to your right and locate a trail that goes up and slightly back behind you funneling into a steep gully. At the top of this gully climb the obvious slab on your left. The slab is very featured with deep water grooves and staircases so there are several weaknesses but it's still a solo with a pack where weight can shift quickly and there's not much positive in the vicinity to grab so use caution. Also keep in mind that if the leader slips or knocks something off that the follower is in the line of fire. This seems basic until it happens so try to keep some distance and stay staggered.", "Getting Out:", "Primary Descent - The primary rappel anchors are located at the very bottom of the right hand wall at it's lowest point, just right of Last Action Hero. Rappel 90' to a nice ledge. To the climber's right of the ledge, Rappel another 50' into the original ascent gully and walk down from here.", "Secondary Descent - The main reason for using this rappel is to climb in the Upper Cookbook, otherwise the primary descent is the easiest. Walk to the extreme left side of the main wall (just left of the climb Skynet) and locate two anchors on a face at head height for a 90' free air rappel. needless to say, make sure both ends of the rope touch the top of the slab below. This lands you on the Cookbook slab just below the upper wall near Spiritual Warfare. If using this descent, once again keep the safety of others in mind by not dropping anything or knocking off any loose rock. Also, a long free air rappel with a heavy pack can be challenging so use proper techniques if necessary, such as lowering your packs separately, rappelling with your pack hanging beneath you or extending your ATC on a personal anchor system, which makes control while lowering much easier. If your pack is light there should be no problem but the extended rappel is still suggested for control as well as the fact that the ATC gets really hot on a free air rappel with a pack."], "path": "3.
